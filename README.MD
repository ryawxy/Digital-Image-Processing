#  Digital Image Processing Homework

This repository contains a collection of assignments from the **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** course at **Sharif University of Technology**.  
Each homework explores fundamental and advanced techniques, implemented through interactive Jupyter notebooks.

---

##  HW1

Introduces the **fundamentals of digital image processing**, covering essential operations and image handling techniques.

### Topics
- Reading and displaying images
- Basic pixel manipulations
- Understanding image formats and color models

>  See the HW1 notebook for hands-on exercises and example images.

---

##  HW2

Focuses on **image enhancement and spatial filtering** to improve image quality and visual appearance.

### Topics
- Image enhancement techniques
- Spatial domain filtering
- Histogram equalization

> Includes code examples and explanations on enhancing image contrast and clarity.

---

##  HW3

Explores **edge detection, morphology, and segmentation** — key operations in computer vision for analyzing image structures.

### Topics
- Edge detection methods (Sobel, Canny, etc.)
- Morphological operations
- Image segmentation

> Demonstrations use classic images such as *Lena* and *Cameraman* for visual clarity.

---

## ️ HW4

Delves into **advanced morphological image processing** techniques, emphasizing structure-based transformations and analysis.

### Topics
- Dilation and Erosion — custom implementations for morphological transformations
- Noise Reduction — removing salt-and-pepper noise using opening and closing
- Parallel Line Extraction — vertical and horizontal line detection using oriented structuring elements
- Edge Detection — morphological gradients for edge extraction
- Object Counting — practical example of counting coins in an image

> This notebook highlights the power of morphology for **cleaning, segmenting, and analyzing** digital images.
